**Abstract**

**Objective**: Estimate differences in the rate of decline in verbal memory by levels of perceived relationship quality among community dwelling adults.
Participants: In the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA), n = 10,109 participants aged 50-89 years were assessed at wave 1 (baseline: 2002-03) and followed-up over 16 years to wave 9 (2017-18). 

**Methods**: Verbal memory was assessed bienially by tests of immediate and delayed word-recall. Positive and negative aspects of perceived relationship quality (social support and strain, respectively) were measured by relationship type (spouse/partner; children; extended family members; friends). Random effects within-between (REWB) modelling was used to estimate the associations between levels of social support/strain and (i) baseline levels of memory (main effects), and (ii) the decline in memory per 2-year interval (interaction with time).
